# Flat Price Prediction
## Overview

This project aims to predict the Flat price using a machine learning model built with XGBoost. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate property prices based on various features, such as location, area, number of rooms, Floor.sqm, and more.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is used due to its efficiency, scalability, and
